I'm a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. [Peter Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/). Before that, I received my Master from KAUST in Dec. 2021 and B.Eng with honor from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2019. I've interned at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index), [CMU Xulab](https://xulabs.github.io/), [NUS CVML Group](https://sites.google.com/comp.nus.edu.sg/cvml/about-us?authuser=0), and [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en). 


Research Interests
======
* Machine learning optimization in the large-scale data/model era.
* Conceptual-level knowledge transfer learning: theories and applications.

Specifically, now I work on Machine Learning Optimization and Zero-Shot Learning.
