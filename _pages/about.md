I'm a graduate student at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) under the supervision of Prof. [Mohamed Elhoseiny](http://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/home). Before that, I received my B.Eng with honor from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2019. I've interned at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index), [CMU Xulab](https://xulabs.github.io/), [NUS CVML Group](https://sites.google.com/comp.nus.edu.sg/cvml/about-us?authuser=0), and [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en).
