I am currently a Computer Science PhD candidate, working under the guidance of Prof. [Peter Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/). Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree under the supervision of Prof. [Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/) at [KAUST](https://kaust.edu.sa/en) in December 2021. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering with honors from [Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2019. I have had the opportunity to intern at several leading research institutions, including [SonyAI](https://ai.sony/), [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index), [CMU Xulab](https://xulabs.github.io/), [NUS CVML Group](https://sites.google.com/comp.nus.edu.sg/cvml/about-us?authuser=0), and [SenseTime Research](https://www.sensetime.com/en). My primary research interest lies in centralized and federated LLM compression. My work is highly interconnected, featuring significant projects such as the LLM post-training compression algorithm [PV-Tuning (NeurIPS Oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14852), with more on the way; communication-efficient federated learning methods [CohortSqueeze (NeurIPS-W Oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01115), [FedP3 (ICLR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09816), and [EF-BV (NeurIPS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04180); and multimodal language model projects [DACZSL (ICCVW)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12989), [HGR-Net (ECCV)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01386), and [VisualGPT (CVPR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10407).
