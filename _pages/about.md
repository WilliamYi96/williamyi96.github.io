I am currently a PhD student, working under the guidance of Prof. [Peter Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/). Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree under the supervision of Prof. [Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/) at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://kaust.edu.sa/en) in December 2021. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering with honors from [Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2019. My professional experience includes internships at [SonyAI](https://ai.sony/), [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index), [CMU Xulab](https://xulabs.github.io/), [NUS CVML Group](https://sites.google.com/comp.nus.edu.sg/cvml/about-us?authuser=0), and [SenseTime Research](https://www.sensetime.com/en).
